** TODO [2/6] Challenges

   1. [X] Implement, as best as you can, the identity function in your favorite
      language (or the second favorite, if your favorite language happens to be
      Haskell).

      #+begin_src python
        from typing import TypeVar

        A = TypeVar('A')


        def id(x: A) -> A:
            return x
      #+end_src


   1. [X] Implement the composition function in your favorite language. It takes two
      functions as arguments and returns a function that is their composition.

      #+begin_src python
        from typing import Callable, TypeVar

        A = TypeVar('A')
        B = TypeVar('B')
        C = TypeVar('C')


        def compose(f1: Callable[C, B], f2: Callable[B, A]) -> Callable[C, A]:
            def composed(x: C) -> A:
                return f2(f1(x))

            return composed
      #+end_src

   2. [ ] Write a program that tries to test that your composition function
      respects identity.
   3. [ ] Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?
   4. [ ] Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as
      morphisms?
   5. [ ] When is a directed graph a category?
